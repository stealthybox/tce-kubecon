Tanzu Community Edition provides a quick, maintainable way to provision a Kubernetes-centric platform on your infrastructure or cloud-provider of choice. 

It provides a package repository to help you build and manage your toolset.
Additionally, the Carvel tool `kapp` provides an improved way to work on top of Tanzu Community Edition clusters and stay organized.
You can install `kapp` and other Carvel tools, separately, in addition to Tanzu Community Edition.
